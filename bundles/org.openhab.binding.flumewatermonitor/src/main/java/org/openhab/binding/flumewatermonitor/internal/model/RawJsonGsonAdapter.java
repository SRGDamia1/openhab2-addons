/**
 * The {@link RawJsonGsonAdapter} is used to leave a portion of the JSON in String format rather than attempting to
 * deserialize it into a class. This is used for some of the fields in the response DTO that could be missing, null,
 * empty arrays, or a structure that is variable. Because of the possibility of all the nulls, and the variable
 * structure, even using a TypeToken and a generic class fails to properly parse the subclass. To get around it, for the
 * messy fields I'm having gson leave them as strings at the first pass and then deserializing the string in a second
 * pass within the specific request response where I already know what the structure will be.
